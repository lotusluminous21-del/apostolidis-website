   - Feels authentic to the region

2. **Grayscale Complement**
   - Creates sophisticated contrast with black/white/gray
   - Warm tone balances cool neutrals
   - Works as both primary accent and subtle touch
   - High visibility for CTAs and highlights

3. **"A" Logo Stability Symbol**
   - Earth tone suggests foundation and stability
   - Warm color conveys approachability
   - Professional without being cold
   - Can be used for the "A" symbol fill or accent

4. **Trust & Professionalism**
   - Not too bright or aggressive
   - Suggests reliability and craftsmanship
   - Historical weight (ancient Greek pottery tones)
   - Mature and established feeling

### Color Palette Recommendation

```
Primary:     #1A1A1A (Near Black)
Secondary:   #F5F5F5 (Off-White)
Accent:      #C65D3B (Deep Terracotta)
Text:        #333333 (Dark Gray)
Muted:       #888888 (Medium Gray)
```
